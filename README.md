# 2019MLProjects
Some small ongoing projects that are currently functional
Notes:
1. The entity recognition programs require BERT dependencies which I have not uploaded due to their size and system requirements. I uploaded the main files so that they may be viewed, however if someone sees this and does want the dependencies (some of which are custom), I will try to upload them. 
2. In Perpetual Learning, I do not own any of the images, they are used only for educational purposes.

# 2019MLProjects
Some small ongoing projects that are currently functional
Notes:
1. The entity recognition programs require BERT dependencies which I have not uploaded due to their size and system requirements. I uploaded the main files so that they may be viewed, however if someone sees this and does want the dependencies (some of which are custom), I will try to upload them. 
2. In Perpetual Learning, I do not own any of the images, they are used only for educational purposes.
3. My most significant machine learning projects are not in here as they were developed as part of my undergraduate research at RPI and I do not know if I own the rights to them.
